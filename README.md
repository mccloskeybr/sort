The purpose of this project was to prepare for upcoming interviews by
brushing up on the basics in the form of implementing various sorting algorithms.
This repository includes the following sort algorithms:
    - bubble
    - insertion
    - selection
    - quick
    - merge
    - heap

To compile, execute the following gcc command
    'gcc -o sort main.c <file.c>'
where '<file.c>' is the name of the sort you want to test.
All of the sort .c files include a sort method of which links
the call to sort in main.c, and allows for the flexibility of
testing the different sorts easily through linking.

The following resource was used as a refresher and general resource:
